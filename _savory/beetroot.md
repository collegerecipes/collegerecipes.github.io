Ingredients
 
* 1 purple beetroot, sliced
* 50g of goat's cheese log, sliced

2. On the oven tray, add your baguette cut longitudinally
3. Add the sliced beetroot, and the sliced goat's cheese log
4. Sprinkle with oil, salt, and pepper
5. Bake for 15 minutes (or until your cheese goldens slightly)

7. For added crunch, you can add walnuts on the bread right before adding the balsamic

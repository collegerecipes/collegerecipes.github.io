*I credit this recipe to Joshua Weissman. This is a long but satisfying odyssey.
The recipe below makes two loaves, so you can always use half of the ingredients for the dough (not the starter).
I didn't use a banneton or dutch oven, so my recipe is slightly different.
Check out to see how Joshua makes it: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eod5cUxAHRM&t=690s>*

#Ingredients for the whole recipe (starter+dough): 

* 845g all-purpose flour + more for dusting surfaces and your proofing bag

##Directions for making your sourdough bread (this is a two-day long process)

###Ingredients:
**Levain:**
* 45 mature starter
* 45g unbleached all-purpose flour
* 45g stone-ground whole-wheat flour
* 90g filtered water at room temperature

**Dough**:
*You can use half of the quantities below if you want to make one loaf only*
* 273g unbleached bread flour
* 500g all-purpose flour
* 175g stone-ground whole-wheat flour
* 660g filtered water at 35°C

###Directions

**9am:** Making the levain
Combine Levain ingredients in a glass bowl, mix, and set aside in an oven with the light on (no heat) or in any warm room until 15:00

**14:25:** Autolyse
Mix the "dough" ingredients together to hydrate the flour. Let it sit for 30mn covered.

**15:00:** 
Add 18g of fine sea salt and the levain to your dough. Don't knead, use the Rhubaud method to mix.
Cover and let it sit for 1.5 hour to begin bulk fermentation. 

**16:30:** 1st fold

**16:45:** 2nd fold 

**17:15:** 3rd fold

**19:00** Pre-shaping 
Scoop the dough on a non-floured surface. Paint a flour line in the middle of the dough and divide in two loaves. Using a floured bench scraper, make little balls then cover with overturned bowl for 15mn. Remove bowls and let the balls sit uncovered for 10mn.

**19:25**: Shape your loaves. 
This is the most technical part, I suggest you watch YouTube videos for that part. 
Place your loaves in bowls that are lined with floured kitchen towel. Cover with plastic wrap and place in fridge overnight. 

**9:00am the next day:**
Heat your oven at 260C

## Aliya

Hi! My name is Aliya, and I am currently a medical student in Dublin, Ireland. 

I am French-American of Indian descent, and I grew up in Antananarivo, Madagascar. My cuisine is thus influenced by Malagasy, Indian, American, and French cultures. I've always been passionate about cooking and baking since I was little. This love for creating in the kitchen came from my grandmother and mother. 

After graduating from high school, I moved to Ithaca, NY where I was not paying attention to what I was eating. I discovered how little time I had to cook. When I moved to St Andrews for my Masters, I became more conscious of what I was putting in my body and decided to start writing down what I was eating. This is how this website was born. I also thought it would be a good way to access my recipes no matter where I was in the world because I never know where the next adventure will be!

I have tried all of the recipes here, but some images are free unsplash images because my photography skills suck. 

I hope you find joy in reading through them!

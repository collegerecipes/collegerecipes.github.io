## Aliya

Hi! My name is Aliya, and I am currently a medical student in Dublin, Ireland. 

I am French-American of Indian descent, and I grew up in Antananarivo, Madagascar. My cuisine is thus influenced by Malagasy, Indian, American, and French cultures. I've always been passionate about cooking and baking since I was little. I think my grandmother and mother are the best cooks in the world!

After graduating from high school, I moved to Ithaca NY to study biology and business. I discovered how little time I had to cook. When I moved to St Andrews, UK for my masters, I thought it would be good to have a collection of all my recipes. 

I have tried all of them, but some images are free unsplash images. 

I hope you enjoy!
